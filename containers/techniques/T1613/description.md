Here's a comprehensive technical description for T1613 - Container and Resource Discovery:

Overview of the Technique:
T1613 - Container and Resource Discovery is a technique that allows adversaries to discover containers and other resources available within a container environment. This can include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster. Adversaries may use this information to determine which methods they should utilize for execution or lateral movement in the environment.

How it Works Technically:
The technique involves querying various APIs within a container environment to discover available resources. For example, using the Docker API and Kubernetes API, an adversary can view logs that may leak information about the environment, such as the configuration of the cluster, which services are available, and what cloud provider is being utilized. Additionally, an adversary may use these APIs to query for container names or other resources within a container environment.

Common Implementations:
The technique can be implemented by various means within a container environment. For example, using web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or directly accessing the Docker and Kubernetes APIs. Adversaries can also use tools such as kubectl to query for information about containers and other resources within a cluster. Additionally, an adversary may utilize packet analysis to determine which resources are available on a network segment in order to perform lateral movement.

Prerequisites and Requirements:
To successfully implement T1613 - Container and Resource Discovery, the following prerequisites and requirements must be met:
- Access to a container environment with APIs such as Docker API or Kubernetes API
- Knowledge of how to query these APIs for information about containers and other resources within the environment.
- Understanding of how adversaries may use this information to perform lateral movement or execution in the environment.

Impact and Consequences:
The impact and consequences of T1613 - Container and Resource Discovery can be significant, as it allows adversaries to gain a deeper understanding of an organizationâ€™s container environment and how they may proceed with further attacks. By discovering which containers are available within the environment and what services are running on them, an adversary may determine which methods to utilize for execution or lateral movement. Additionally, by querying logs and other resources using the Docker and Kubernetes APIs, an adversary may gain insight into the configuration of a container environment, which can be exploited further in attacks. Overall, T1613 - Container and Resource Discovery is a technique that should not be underestimated as it can provide significant intelligence for adversaries looking to attack organizations with container environments.
