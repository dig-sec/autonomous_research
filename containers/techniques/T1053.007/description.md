COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH SUMMARY:
Research Source 1: MITRE ATT&CK: T1053.007 - Container Orchestration Job
Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.

Overview of the technique: Container orchestration jobs are used to schedule deployments of containers configured to execute malicious code on various nodes within a cluster, providing persistence for an adversary in maintaining their presence within a network.
How it works technically: Kubernetes CronJobs or similar tools may be utilized by adversaries to set up automated scheduling tasks that deploy and configure containers with malicious code to run at a specific date and time. These jobs can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, allowing for persistence within the cluster.
Common implementations: Kubernetes is one such container orchestration tool commonly used by adversaries in scheduling deployment of malicious containers via CronJobs. Other tools such as Docker Swarm and Mesos may also be utilized to accomplish similar tasks.
Prerequisites and requirements: Adversaries must have access to a Kubernetes cluster or similar container orchestration tool, along with the necessary privileges to schedule deployments of malicious containers via CronJobs. Additionally, they must have knowledge of how to configure these tools and understand the underlying technologies involved in scheduling deployment tasks.
Impact and consequences: Deployment of malicious containers via CronJobs can result in a compromise of sensitive systems within a network or exfiltration of sensitive data from those systems. Additionally, adversaries may use this technique to maintain persistence within a cluster, allowing for long-term access to resources without being detected by security teams.
